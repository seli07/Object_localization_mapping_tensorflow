# Object_localization_mapping_tensorflow only dobot
tensorflow implementation of object localization and mapping of dobot magician from frozen inference graph

after freezing an inference graph place the provided files in the google standard library of object detection available at https://github.com/tensorflow/models 

and place Object_detection_webcam_dobot_still.py under object detection folder and visualization_utils.py under utils

I am still working on an elegant implementation
